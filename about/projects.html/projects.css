You can list the programming languages that you are familiar with in your portfolio by creating a section specifically for listing your technical skills. This section should include a list of the programming languages that you know and any relevant experience or projects that you have completed using those languages. You can also include any relevant certifications or coursework that you have completed. It's a good idea to prioritize the languages that you are most proficient in and to provide specific examples of how you have used those languages in your work.

For example, you might include a list similar to the following:

Proficient in Java:
Completed several projects using Java, including a back-end web application and a mobile app.
Earned a Java certification through an online course.
Familiar with Python:
Used Python to complete data analysis projects and create scripts for automating tasks.
Currently learning more about machine learning and artificial intelligence using Python.
Experience with C++:
Created a computer game using C++ while completing my degree in computer science.
By including this information in your portfolio, you can give potential employers or clients a sense of your technical skills and experience. It will also help you to stand out from other candidates and showcase your abilities as a programmer.
